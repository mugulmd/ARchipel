@ Estelle_Cecil_0
[Cecil]  Hello?
[Estelle] (Err… an intelligent mushroom?) 
	Hi, tiny fungus, you seem not feeling well… almost dehydrated?
	Do you want some water?
[Cecil]  No, no way, I am allergic to water.
	Also do not call me in that way, you the ugly witch.
[Estelle] allergic to water?
	Sounds interesting...
	I never heard of such things.
	Maybe I can help you cue it, it seems an interesting subject...
[Cecil]  Would it be possible? 
	I’ve struggled with this for many years!
[Estelle] I’m confident about that… but…. 
	well, it’s not free, you know, the cost
[Cecil]  Err…. How about some gold, 
	you are a talented magician right?
[Estelle] Oh, gold is okay, 
	but you have to show it to me before the curation.
[Cecil]  So troublesome...
	I store it on the rainforest island, 
	You can go with me, if you want.
#(They go to the fungus island, on the way to gold)

@ Estelle_Cecil_1
[Estelle] … I seldom been this before,
	There are lots of mana, it endows your intelligence right?
[Cecil]  No, in this forest it seems natural to have intelligence.

@ Estelle_Cecil_2
[Cecil]  Here, this is some of my treasure, is it adequate?

@ Estelle_Cecil_3
#If Cecil has a special emerald)
[Estelle] ...I think that emerald is more attractive to me.
	You didn’t need this right, as a merchant?
[Cecil]  That emerald? Oh… okay,

@ Estelle_Cecil_4
#Otherwise:
[Estelle] some of this is adequate, 
	Just take your golds to my house, I will give your curation if you want

@ Estelle_Cecil_5
#(If Cecil goes to Estelle’s house..)
[Cecil]  Hello?
[Estelle] Oh, you are that mushroom right?
[Cecil]  call me Cecil.
[Estelle] Ok, ok, Mr Cecil, shall we start checking?
[Cecil]  of course.

@ Estelle_Cecil_5
#(After a period of time)
[Estelle] Are you really allergic to the water?
[Cecil] .... Maybe, someone told me that.
[Estelle] I think you can contact with water, 
	They must have mistaken something.
	your body and mana is designed for living in the water
[Cecil]  Err...god but I think it will kill me, I cannot risk this
[Estelle] You can do that, tiny mushroom :)
#(If Cecil wants to resolve the issue, it still need to be brave, or some accidents might help him remind the experience with Estelle)



@ Estelle_Kokko_Talk
[Kokko]  Hello, have you ever seen other frogs?
[Estelle] frogs?... But, sorry, you are the first frog I’ve seen
[Kokko]  Oh god…
[Estelle] Have you lost your friends?
[Kokko]  No, I lost my family years ago, I have searched for them for a long time…
[Estelle] That was a sad story…
	The map seemed interesting, could you show me it?
[Kokko]  Fine 
#(Estelle copy the map)
[Estelle] Wow,
[Kokko]  I have explored many islands to draw this map, I have put lots of effort in it.

@ Cecil_Kokko_FirstMeet
[Cecil]  What are you doing here, you stupid green ball? 
	Who do you think you are... 
	coming here as if it’s your home... 
	destroying my beach with your ugly shipwreck trash?
[Kokko]  Excuse me, excuse me, mister. 
	I didn’t want to bother you at all. 
	I am searching for my family, 
	do you happen to have seen any other frogs around your land? 
[Cecil]  Eeeeh, no and thank god! 
	You don’t seem like the best company around. 
	Look what, my son, I don’t give information for free. 
	What are you willing to pay to know more about your ugly friends?
{Should Kokko pay ?}Cecil_Kokko_Pay/Cecil_Kokko_Refuse

@Cecil_Kokko_Pay
[Kokko]  Eeeh, pay? 
	I only have my boat and maps and a few jars with insects as a meal. 
[Cecil]  Ok, ok, you’re not just ugly, but also poor. 
	I’ll take the insects. 
	Long story short - 
	go west from here, 
	across the floating island and then turn left. 
	All clear? 
	Yes, of course. 
	Now give me those insects!
[Kokko] Oh, ok, let me get those for you.  
	But… Wait, what do you mean by a floating island?
[Cecil]  Ah, you’ll see it when you pass by. 
	No more questions, ok? 

@Cecil_Kokko_Refuse
[Kokko] Eeeh, pay ?
	No thanks, I'll pass...
[Cecil] Well then bye bye, and don't come back !

@ Cecil_Kokko_Adventure
[Cecil]  Let’s goooooooo! 
	It’s time to rule the world! 
	Get over here, you useless amphibia! 
	Start that shipwreck immediately and let’s go!

[Cecil] .... Maybe, someone told me that.
[Estelle] I think you can have contact with water, 
	They must have mistaken something.
[Cecil]  Err...god, but I think it will kill me, I'm not sure I want to risk this

@Estelle_Cecil_Aquaphobia_Overcome
[Cecil] Ok let's give it a try

@Estelle_Cecil_Aquaphobia_Fear
[Cecil] No way Jose
