@ Estelle_Rorie_0
[Rorie] Hello, do you know how to let the floating island float again…?
	My island fell to the ground... and...
[Estelle] Oh, poor girl, an ancient floating island? 
	Could you take me there? 
	I need to investigate first.

@ Estelle_Rorie_1
[Estelle] Emm... 
	The floating island exhaust the mana, and fell down 
	If we can find where can I input mana for the island,
	The island will float again...
[Rorie] Sorry... but I know nothing about that,
	the island just fell off several days ago.

@ Estelle_Rorie_2
[Estelle] Wait, the emerald is shining…
[Rorie]  Something wrong?
[Estelle] No, the emerald has some reactions to the island!
	It may indicate something

@ Estelle_Rorie_3
[Estelle] Oh, something is hidden here
[Rorie]  But I cannot see anything
[Estelle] Wait a minute….
	....
	........

@ Estelle_Rorie_4
[Estelle] Okay, it is an altar
[Rorie]  I think we should put the emerald on it
[Estelle] maybe… I think you should return to the floating island
[Rorie]  You mean you found a solution?
[Estelle] Yeah, but I would like to research this altar for a bit
	I have never seen such wonderful magical things.
	The altar supports the floating island.

@ Estelle_Rorie_5
[Estelle] well....done! fantasitic ancient altars, 
	it deserves.
	Maybe I can model after that, to create my own island...
	Emmm...
	Still need lots of resources... god

@ Estelle_Cecil_0
[Cecil]  Hello?
[Estelle] (Err… an intelligent mushroom?) 
	Hi, tiny fungus, you seem not feeling well… almost dehydrated?
	Do you want some water?
[Cecil]  No, no way, I am allergic to water.
	Also do not call me in that way, you the ugly witch.
[Estelle] allergic to water?
	Sounds interesting...
	I never heard of such things.
	Maybe I can help you cue it, it seems an interesting subject...
[Cecil]  Would it be possible? 
	I’ve struggled with this for many years!
[Estelle] I’m confident about that… but…. 
	well, it’s not free, you know, the cost
[Cecil]  Err…. How about some gold, 
	you are a talented magician right?
[Estelle] Oh, gold is okay, 
	but you have to show it to me before the curation.
[Cecil]  So troublesome...
	I store it on the rainforest island, 
	You can go with me, if you want.
#(They go to the fungus island, on the way to gold)

@ Estelle_Cecil_1
[Estelle] … I seldom been this before,
	There are lots of mana, it endows your intelligence right?
[Cecil]  No, in this forest it seems natural to have intelligence.

@ Estelle_Cecil_2
[Cecil]  Here, this is some of my treasure, is it adequate?

@ Estelle_Cecil_3
#If Cecil has a special emerald)
[Estelle] ...I think that emerald is more attractive to me.
	You didn’t need this right, as a merchant?
[Cecil]  That emerald? Oh… okay,

@ Estelle_Cecil_4
#Otherwise:
[Estelle] some of this is adequate, 
	Just take your golds to my house, I will give your curation if you want

@ Estelle_Cecil_5
#(If Cecil goes to Estelle’s house..)
[Cecil]  Hello?
[Estelle] Oh, you are that mushroom right?
[Cecil]  call me Cecil.
[Estelle] Ok, ok, Mr Cecil, shall we start checking?
[Cecil]  of course.

@ Estelle_Cecil_5
#(After a period of time)
[Estelle] Are you really allergic to the water?
[Cecil] .... Maybe, someone told me that.
[Estelle] I think you can contact with water, 
	They must have mistaken something.
	your body and mana is designed for living in the water
[Cecil]  Err...god but I think it will kill me, I cannot risk this
[Estelle] You can do that, tiny mushroom :)
#(If Cecil wants to resolve the issue, it still need to be brave, or some accidents might help him remind the experience with Estelle)



@ Estelle_Kokko_0
[Kokko]  Hello, have you ever seen other frogs?
[Estelle] frogs?... But, sorry, you are the first frog I’ve seen
[Kokko]  Oh god…
[Estelle] Have you lost your friends?
[Kokko]  No, I lost my family years ago, I have searched for them for a long time…
[Estelle] That was a sad story…
	The map seemed interesting, could you show me it?
[Kokko]  Fine, 
#(Estelle copy the map)
[Estelle] Wow,
[Kokko]  I have explored many islands to draw this map, I have put lots of effort in it.

@ Cecil_Kokko_0
[Cecil]  What are you doing here, you stupid green ball? 
	Who do you think you are... 
	coming here as if it’s your home... 
	destroying my beach with your ugly shipwreck trash?
[Kokko]  Excuse me, excuse me, mister. 
	I didn’t want to bother you at all. 
	I am searching for my family, 
	do you happen to have seen any other frogs around your land? 
[Cecil]  Eeeeh, no and thank god! 
	You don’t seem like the best company around. 
	Look what, my son, I don’t give information for free. 
	What are you willing to pay to know more about your ugly friends?
[Kokko]  Eeeh, pay? 
	I only have my boat and maps and a few jars with insects as a meal. 
[Cecil]  Ok, ok, you’re not just ugly, but also poor. 
	I’ll take the insects. 
	Long story short - 
	go west from here, 
	across the floating island and then turn left. 
	All clear? 
	Yes, of course. 
	Now give me those insects!
[Kokko]  
	Oh, ok, let me get those for you.  
	But… Wait, what do you mean by a floating island?

[Cecil]  Ah, you’ll see it when you pass by. 
	No more questions, ok? 

@ Cecil_Kokko_1
[Cecil]  Let’s goooooooo! 
	It’s time to rule the world! 
	Get over here, you useless amphibia! 
	Start that shipwreck immediately and let’s go!

@ Rorie_Cecil_2
[Cecil]  Khem… khem… 
	What are you looking at, young lady? 
	You seem very interested in the flowers of my island… 
	Don’t you think it would be more proper to introduce yourself, 
	before invading my space like this?
[Rorie]  Heh? 
	What is going on? 
	Excuse me, but 
	where are you, 
	I don’t see you. 
[Cecil]  Well right in front of you, 
	why don’t you try looking at your feet a bit more often, 
	you might be missing a whole show. 
[Rorie]  Oh, oh, hello little shroom… 
	What is your name? 
	I am Rorie from the floating island.
[Cecil]  Little shroom? 
	Little shroom… 
	how about Cecil 
	The Great, ruler 
	of the tropical islands??? 
	I’d think more before speaking, if I was in your place. 
[Rorie]  Excuse me, Cecil The Great. 
	May I ask you for your help. 
	Have you, 
	by any chance, 
	heard of the magical shrooms that grow on this island? 
[Cecil]  E-excuse me… 
	magic shrooms… 
	What, what are you talking about? 
	I.. 
	I think you’re on the wrong island –
	...
	... 
	#(Cecil started stuttering.)
	Get out of this place, right now! 
	You’re not welcome here! 
	Leaveeee!

@ Rorie_Kokko_0
[Kokko]  Hey! 
	Hey you, 
	can you hear me? 
	Hey...
	where am I...??
	can you tell me what this place is?
#Rorie slid in Kokko’s direction and looked at him astounded.
[Rorie]  Hello and welcome on the floating island. 
	I am Rorie, nice to meet you. 
	What are you seeking here?
[Kokko]  Hi, I am Kokko and I am searching for my family. 
	I lost them years ago, have you maybe seen any frogs around? 
[Rorie]  Oh, well… 
	we did have some frogs inhibiting our island. 
	I could show you some paintings of our frog colony, if you’d like. 
	Maybe you haven’t heard yet, but… there was a catastrophe on our island. 
	A few days ago it fell down on the ground. 
	We used to levitate above the ground, living a peaceful and beautiful life. 
	Ever since this catastrophe took place, we haven’t seen our frogs.  
	We’ve searched for them all over the island, but there is no trace of them. 
	And we are so weak, we’ve lost our vitality. 
	I need to help my island, 
	I need to bring back everything back to normal. 
	But anyways, would you like to see my paintings?
[Kokko]  Yes! Yes! Of course, please show me!

@ Rorie_Kokko_1
[Kokko]  Rorie, let’s go together! 
	Let’s take this boat and let’s find how to bring back your vitality 
	and find my family! 
	We can help each other, 
		what do you think?
[Rorie]  Hmm… 
	maybe you’re right… 
	we are both seeking, 
	we both need to fix this all. 
	Let’s try it, 
	I think I know where we might start. 
	Let’s go to the altar island and dig into this mystery.
